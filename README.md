# FindYourFilmora
Don't like Filmora X? Use this tool to find earlier versions of Filmora

This programs finds the ids of Filmora on official source(platform.wondershare.com). You need to put the id at the end of the link:
http://platform.wondershare.com/rest/v2/downloader/runtime/?client_sign={6C78A9C3-VB95-2721-9342-080027F47A94}&product_id=

Using the same key(client_sign) for all users is a bad thing but I don't have other key(yet)
